## Deploy the sample microserves app and explore observability

### Build the sample application with Terraform

```bash
cd ~/environment/ecs-squid/lab2/mesh-microservice-app/
```

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -out tfplan
```

```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```


----

Monitor the ECS console and wait for all the services Last Deployment state to be indicated as  `completed`

### Start a siege (workload)

In Cloud9 open new terminal window:

get the load balancer DNS name

```bash
lbdns=$(aws ssm get-parameter --name /ecsworkshop/meshlb-dns --query Parameter.Value --output text)
echo $lbdns
```

Open a browser tab on that website address

Then start a "siege":

```bash
siege -c 20 -i http://$lbdns
```

----

After a few minutes you should be able to see the autoscaling of the frontend and crystal services:

You may also notice the lower response times reported by siege.

And the website graphic in the browser showing more frontend and backends responding to queries.

### Explore the observabilty of the deployed application:


#### Letâ€™s review the Container Insights in the console

To review the information, you need to go to the [Cloudwatch console](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-west-1#container-insights:infrastructure/map){:target="_blank"} and select the Insight section, then select Container Insights.

Within this console you will find different views, like the Map View, that will let you see in a graphical representation the services and task of you ECS cluster and some metrics when you select the service from the map:

#### Review traces with X-Ray


Once we have deployed them we will need to wait like 5 minutes to start seeing traces. Now access the [X-Ray console.](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-west-1#xray:service-map/map){:target="_blank"}


Once in the X-Ray console, select Service Map from the left hand side menu. Wait a few seconds for the service map to render.

Whenever you select a node or edge on an AWS X-Ray service map, the X-Ray console shows additional information about the node or edge.
