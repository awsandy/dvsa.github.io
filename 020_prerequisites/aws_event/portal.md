To help you get hands-on as quickly as possible your facilitators have pre-created an AWS environment. In order to access the environment you will need an event access code and an email address. The event access code should have been provided to you upon entry.

To begin with, let's connect to the AWS Workshop Studio, which can be found here https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/ 

* Once the page loads, click the Join Event button which can be found on the right of the page

* After a few moments a one-time password (OTP) will arrive in the inbox of associated with the email address you entered in the previous step. Copy the OTP and paste it in to the field labelled Passcode (9-digit) and click Sign in.

**If you do not recieve a one-time password (OTP), ensure the email address you entered is valid and then click Resent passcode.**

* After signing in with your OTP, you will need to enter the event access code. This will have been provided to you by your event facilator. Enter the code in to the field provided and click Next.
